# MT4-Position-Calculator
Calculate your all potential profits and/or losses, used leverage and possible final account balance at glance before entering any trade

This program runs on Windows, written in C# .NET. 
The source code need to be cleaned atm, but the program works well.

Very useful for those who trades by pyramiding. It is possible to make a trading plan and save your calc results to an XML file (to reopen later).
The program also exports calculation results to MT4 expert advisor settings format, so you can write an Expert strategy and execute it fast after making a trading plan.
